In the real world, many people get cheated by real estate brokers and contract agents with the price of the house. So this will help a lot of people to find the price of houses when they are selling or buying.

## Limitations
* When adding more deep neural networks the validation loss getting reducing, But in my system I can't increase neural networks, for this deeplearning model it's took me 1-2 hour to fit the model.

## Description
This DeepLearning model to predict house prices.

## Requirements
#### Programming Language
* Python3 (Jupyter Notebook)
#### Libraries
##### Data Manipulation
* Numpy
* Pandas
##### DeepLearning Model
* tensorflow
* keras

## Project Structure
* Data Cleaning
#### DeepLearning Model
* Sequential Layers
* Fitted model using **Train Data**
* Saved DeepLearning Model in **h5** file format
* Load saved Model

## Project Setup
* Clone project
* Create a branch
* Open jupyter_notebook.ipynb
* Make changes in Sequential Layers to reduce validation loss
* Fit model by using Train Data
* Save Model in h5 format
* Create a pull request
